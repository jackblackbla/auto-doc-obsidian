## Changes Summary

The code changes in `summarize_diff_to_md.py` involve updates to the API URL, model name, and payload configuration for interacting with the DeepSeek API. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **API URL Update**:
   - The API endpoint was changed from `"https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions"` to `"https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions"`, removing the `v1` versioning.

2. **Whitespace Fix**:
   - A trailing whitespace was removed in the `chunk_diff` function where `current_file = None` was defined.

3. **Model Name Update**:
   - The model name in the payload was updated from `"deepseek-chat-1.1"` to `"deepseek-chat"`.

4. **Payload Configuration**:
   - The `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters were removed from the payload.
   - A new parameter `"stream": False` was added to the payload.

These changes appear to be adjustments for compatibility or updates to the DeepSeek API, along with minor code cleanup.
