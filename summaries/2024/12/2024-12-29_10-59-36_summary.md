## Changes Summary

### 여러 파일
The changes to `summarize_diff_to_md.py` introduce several enhancements and improvements:

1. **Token Estimation and Chunking**:
   - Added a `estimate_tokens` function to approximate the token count of text.
   - Modified `chunk_diff` to split large diffs into manageable chunks based on token size (`MAX_DIFF_SIZE`) and the number of files (`MAX_FILES_PER_SUMMARY`).
   - Large files are split into smaller chunks, while smaller files are grouped together.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling in `get_diff_text` and `create_markdown_file` to catch and report subprocess errors.
   - Enhanced error reporting in `summarize_diff` to include API response details.

3. **Contextual Summarization**:
   - Added a `context` parameter to `summarize_diff` to provide additional context for the API request.
   - Updated the system prompt to be more specific about the summarization focus.

4. **Git Information**:
   - Added retrieval of the commit message (`commit_msg`) in `create_markdown_file` and included it in the markdown output.

5. **Markdown File Creation**:
   - Modified the main function to process diff chunks individually and combine their summaries into a final markdown file.
   - Added a check to ensure only successful summaries are included in the final output.

6. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Removed the `summarize_large_diff` function and integrated its functionality into the main flow using the new chunking mechanism.
   - Improved code organization and readability.

These changes enhance the script's ability to handle large diffs more efficiently, provide better error handling, and produce more informative summaries.
