## Changes Summary

### 여러 파일
Here’s a concise summary of the code changes:

1. **`api_client.py`**:
   - Added a new `APIClient` class to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to an API.
   - Supports optional API key authentication and session management.
   - Includes error handling for failed requests.

2. **`logger.py`**:
   - Introduced a `CustomLogger` class for logging messages to both a file and the console.
   - Logs are saved in a specified directory with a timestamped filename.
   - Supports different log levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical).

3. **`config_manager.py`**:
   - Added a `ConfigManager` class to manage configuration settings stored in a JSON file.
   - Provides methods to load, save, get, and set configuration values.

4. **`database.py`**:
   - Introduced a `DatabaseManager` class to manage database connections and execute queries.
   - Includes methods to connect, execute queries, and close the connection (currently placeholder logic).

### Key Points:
- **New Functionality**: Added utility classes for API interaction, logging, configuration management, and database operations.
- **Refactoring**: Each class is modular and focused on a single responsibility.
- **Potential Breaking Changes**: None, as these are new additions.
- **Improvements**: Enhanced error handling, logging, and configuration management.

These changes lay the groundwork for a more structured and maintainable codebase.
